gridutils
Grid Utilities
Version 0.51

Provides C library functions and utilities for handling 2D grids. Developed
and used for grids generated by `gridgen', but can be used to handle arbitrary
2D quadrilateral grids.

`gridutils' is a free software. See LICENSE for details.

Please send comments and bugs to pavel.sakov<at>gmail.com .

Includes the following utilities:

- getbound
  (extracts the bounding polygon)
- getnodes
  (validates and converts grids between double density, center and corner 
  formats)
- gridbathy
  (interpolates scattered data onto the grid)
- insertgrid
  (inserts nodes from one grid into another at specified location in index
  space)
- setbathy
  (given a three-column data file (X Y Z), sets values in specified index range
  to a specified value)
- subgrid
  (extracts nodes for a subgrid specified by index range)
- xy2ij
  (converts point coordinates between physical and index spaces)

This code is developed and used under i386/Linux. It should be straightforward 
to port it elsewhere. Please let me know if you managed to do it.

Beware that the configure script currently does not do much more than a couple
of checks. It should be viewed rather as a prototype for the future than a
multi-platform configuration tool.

To compile, run:

configure
make
(make install)

Please acknowledge use of this software in publications.

Good luck!
